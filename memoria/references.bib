  abstract = "Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the
              Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design
              science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and
              verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational
              behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the
              boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating
              new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to
              the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of
              people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to
              describe the performance of design-science research in
              Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear
              guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the
              research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and
              understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved
              in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three
              recent exemplars in the research literature are used to
              demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with
              an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality

               in information systems (IS) have been suggested. There has,
               however, been little academic investigation of the basic forms
               of reasoning underlying these models, namely: deduction,
               induction and abduction. We argue that a more thorough
               investigation of these reasoning logics allows for a more
               comprehensive understanding of the DSR models and the building
               of information systems design theories (ISDTs). In particular,
               the question of whether prescriptive design knowledge can be
               ‘theory driven'' by descriptive kernel theory can be addressed.
               First, we show that it is important to distinguish between a
               context of discovery and a context of justification in theory
               building and to consider the fundamental forms of reasoning in
               this light. We present an idealized model of the
               hypothetico-deductive method, showing how progress is achieved
               in science. This model includes the contexts of discovery and
               justification and the matching forms of reasoning. Second, we
               analyze frameworks for IS DSR and ISDT in comparison with this
               idealized model. This analysis suggests that few frameworks
               explicitly refer to the underlying forms of reasoning.
               Illustrative case studies with first-hand accounts of how IS DSR
               occurs in practice lend support to the conception of the
               idealized model. We conclude that work on methodological models
               for IS DSR and ISDT building would be given a firmer base and
               some differences in opinion resolved if there was explicit
               reflection on the underlying contexts of both discovery and
               justification and the forms of reasoning implicated, as in our

              range of quality frameworks have been proposed in the literature,
              none of these have been widely accepted in practice and none has
              emerged as a potential standard. As a result, conceptual models
              continue to be evaluated in practice in an ad hoc way, based on
              common sense, subjective opinions and experience. For conceptual
              modelling to progress from an ``art'' to an engineering

              should work together to establish a common standard (or

              some initial efforts towards developing a common standard for

              a certain artifact is an instance of some artifact kind: (O) What
              is it for an artifact a to belong to kind K? According to the

              properties of the object we exploit in order to decide whether a
              certain artifact belongs to a certain kind. (G) thus becomes: (E)

              for conducting social science research, and has been proposed as
              an alternative to the more prevalent paradigms of positivism and
              interpretivism. Few papers, however, have offered clear guidance
              for applying this philosophy to actual research methodologies.
              Under critical realism, a causal explanation for a given
              phenomenon is inferred by explicitly identifying the means by
              which structural entities and contextual conditions interact to
              generate a given set of events. Consistent with this view of
              causality, we propose a set of methodological principles for
              conducting and evaluating critical realism-based explanatory case
              study research within the information systems field. The
              principles are derived directly from the ontological and

              the utility of each of the principles through examples drawn from

               beginning with how to get ideas about research, how to refine
               your research question and the actual design of the experiment,
               leading on to statistical procedure and assistance with writing
               up of results. While many books look at the fundamentals of
               doing successful experiments and include good coverage of
               statistical techniques, this book very importantly considers the
               process in chronological order with specific attention given to
               effective design in the context of likely methods needed and
               expected results. Without full assessment of these aspects, the
               experience and results may not end up being as positive as one

               Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important
               enterprise of how the discovery of theory from
               data---systematically obtained and analyzed in social
               research---can be furthered. The discovery of theory from
               data---grounded theory---is a major task confronting sociology,
               for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is
               understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important,

               and applications.In Part I of the book, ``Generation Theory by

               sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory,
               both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the
               systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In

               from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data

               chapter describes a different statistical technique, ranging
               from basic concepts like central tendency and describing
               distributions to more advanced concepts such as t tests,
               regression, repeated measures ANOVA, and factor analysis. Each
               chapter begins with a short description of the statistic and
               when it should be used. This is followed by a more in-depth
               explanation of how the statistic works. Finally, each chapter
               ends with an example of the statistic in use, and a sample of
               how the results of analyses using the statistic might be written
               up for publication. A glossary of statistical terms and symbols

               classification. What it adds to previous discussions of these
               topics is that it addresses them with respect to human-made
               entities, that is, artefacts. As the chapters in the book show,
               questions of identity and classification require other
               treatments and lead to other answers for artefacts than for
               natural entities. These answers are of interest to philosophers
               not only for their clarification of artefacts as a category of
               things but also for the new light they may shed on these issue
               with respect to to natural entities. This volume is structured
               in three parts. The contributions in Part I address basic
               ontological and metaphysical questions in relation to artefact
               kinds: How should we conceive of artefact kinds? Are they real
               kinds? How are identity conditions for artefacts and artefact
               kinds related? The contributions in Part II address
               meta-ontological questions: What, exactly, should an ontological
               account of artefact kinds provide us with? What scope can it aim
               for? Which ways of approaching the ontology of artefact kinds
               are there, how promising are they, and how should we assess
               this? In Part III, the essays offer engineering practice rather

               artefacts and on what grounds? What makes specific classes of

               theoretical text on the foundations of anthropology and
               sociology. Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French
               anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is
               simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social
               science and a general account of how human action should be
               understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the
               principle which negotiates between objective structures and
               practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which
               have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The
               author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate
               his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial
               strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the
               dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the
               objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to
               reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach
               lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and,
               through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory
               of symbolic power.",

              nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance
              of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are
              neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology.
              The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction,
              and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A
              taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories
              with respect to the manner in which four central goals are
              addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription.
              Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory
              for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for
              predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5)
              theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of
              each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is
              demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The
              paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist
              and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints.
              In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under
              development can influence the choice of an epistemological
              approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each
              theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that

              knowledge-intensive firms. Yet the concept of knowledge is
              complex and its relevance to organization theory has been insuf
              ficiently developed. The paper offers a review and critique of
              current approaches, and outlines an alternative. First, common
              images of knowledge in the organizational literature as embodied,
              embedded, embrained, encultured and encoded are identified and,
              to summarize popular writings on knowledge work, a typology of
              organizations and knowledge types is constructed. How ever,
              traditional assumptions about knowledge, upon which most current
              speculation about organizational knowledge is based, offer a
              compartmental ized and static approach to the subject. Drawing
              from recent studies of the impact of new technologies and from
              debates in philosophy, linguistics, social theory and cognitive
              science, the second part of the paper introduces an altern ative.
              Knowledge (or, more appropriately, knowing) is analyzed as an
              active process that is mediated, situated, provisional, pragmatic
              and contested. Rather than documenting the types of knowledge
              that capitalism currently demands the approach suggests that
              attention should be focused on the (culturally located) systems
              through which people achieve their knowing, on the changes that
              are occurring within such systems, and on the processes through

              DSRIS can or should be instrumental in developing and refining

               are encouraged to memorize and adhere to the ``scientific
               method''---a model of inquiry consisting of five to seven neatly
               laid-out steps, often in the form of a flowchart. But walk into
               the office of a theoretical physicist or the laboratory of a
               biochemist and ask ``Which step are you on?'' and you will
               likely receive a blank stare. This is not how science works. But
               science does work, and here award-winning teacher and scholar
               Steven Gimbel provides students the tools to answer for
               themselves this question: What actually is the scientific
               method? Exploring the Scientific Method pairs classic and
               contemporary readings in the philosophy of science with
               milestones in scientific discovery to illustrate the
               foundational issues underlying scientific methodology. Students
               are asked to select one of nine possible fields---astronomy,
               physics, chemistry, genetics, evolutionary biology, psychology,
               sociology, economics, or geology---and through carefully crafted
               case studies trace its historical progression, all while
               evaluating whether scientific practice in each case reflects the
               methodological claims of the philosophers. This approach allows
               students to see the philosophy of science in action and to
               determine for themselves what scientists do and how they ought
               to do it. Exploring the Scientific Method will be a welcome

               researchers in choosing an appropriate strategy for evaluation
               of the design artifacts and design theories that form the output
               from DSR. The extended DSR evaluation framework asks the DSR
               researcher to consider (as input to the choice of the DSR
               evaluation strategy) contextual factors of goals, conditions,
               and constraints on the DSR evaluation, e.g. the type and level
               of desired rigor, the type of artifact, the need to support
               formative development of the designed artifacts, the properties

               support matching these in the first instance to one or more DSR
               evaluation strategies, including the choice of ex ante (prior to

              challenged on the basis of its relevance to practice. This paper
              engages with the concept of a design science as it is considered
              to offer some answers to this enduring debate. The paper goes on
              to conclude, rather sceptically, that design science may not
              offer such a distinct perspective on management as a field of
              study. Our scepticism is based on the design science scholars'
              rather arbitrary use of Simon's intellectual legacy, particularly
              the superficial differentiation between explanatory-based and
              prescriptive-based social sciences, and the promises such a
              comparison holds for prescriptive outcomes in management. The
              paper contributes to the design science debate in management by
              identifying three different types of design, each based on
              different ways artefacts emerge. These identified differences
              have profound consequences for understanding design science as an
              explicitly organized and systematic approach to design. We
              conclude that later conceptualizations of design science do have
              a place, but offer only a particular perspective -- one that is
              relevant for a narrow set of organizational phenomena. Finally,
              we argue that the design analogy is an important one in the
              current debate about the nature of management studies if it
              highlights the creation of novelty and disruption of stability.
              It also offers a way of thinking about the exposition of
              uncertainty, in contrast to highlighting rules and principles

               way of using action research in design science, which starts
               with an artifact, and then tests it under conditions of practice
               by solving concrete problems with them. The aim of this way of
               using action research in design science is to bridge the gap
               between the idealizations made when designing the artifact and
               the concrete conditions of practice that occur in real-world
               problems. The paper analyzes the role of idealization in design
               science and compares it with the requirements of rigor and
               relevance. It then proposes a way of bridging the gap between
               idealization and practice by means of action research, called
               technical action research (TAR) in this paper. The core of TAR
               is that the researcher plays three roles, which must be kept
               logically separate, namely of artifact developer, artifact
               investigator, and client helper. Finally, TAR is compared to
               other approaches of using action research in design science, and
               with canonical action research.",

               Traditional focus group methods must be adapted to meet two
               specific goals of design research. For the evaluation of an
               artifact design, exploratory focus groups (EFGs) study the
               artifact to propose improvements in the design. The results of
               the evaluation are used to refine the design and the cycle of
               build and evaluate using EFGs continues until the artifact is
               released for field test in the application environment. Then,
               the field test of the design artifact may employ confirmatory
               focus groups (CFGs) to establish the utility of the artifact in
               field use. Rigorous investigation of the artifact requires
               multiple CFGs to be run with opportunities for quantitative and
               qualitative data collection and analyses across the multiple
               CFGs. In this chapter, we discuss the adaptation of focus groups

  abstract  = "The supposed opposition of rigor versus relevance is based on
               the mistaken idea that rigor consists of linear technology

               context-dependence of relevance as well as the incorporation of
               conditions of practice necessary for applicability of knowledge.
               Historical insights from the history of science and technology
               show that technology is not transferred linearly from research
               to practice, and that technical science has more in common with
               social science than a superficial comparison would reveal. In
               both fields, (1) practical problems are often solved without
               input from research, and (2) researchers often investigate past
               innovations rather than prepare future ones. And in both fields,
               (3) relevance is context-dependent, because it depends on
               changeable goals of stakeholders. Applicability is a more
               important requirement than relevance to a goal, where
               applicability is the match between theory and the condition of
               practice of a concrete case. This paper summarizes insights from
               the history of science and technology to substantiate these
               points and provides an extended framework for design science to
               incorporate these insights. Since relevance depends on problem
               choice, the paper also summarizes what is known about classes of
               relevant practical problems and research questions in technical
               design science and discusses the relevance of this for IS design

               There are several unresolved concerns and issues in design
               research (DR). Some examples are the outcomes of design
               research, the role of theorizing in DR, how to conduct

  abstract = "Abstract. While a large body of research exists on the
              development and implementation of software, organizations are
              increasingly acquiring enterprise software packages [e.g.
              enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems] instead of custom
              developing their own software applications. To be competitive in
              the marketplace, software package development firms must manage
              the three-pronged trade-off between cost, quality and
              functionality. Surprisingly, prior research has made little
              attempt to investigate the characteristics of packaged software
              that influence management information system (MIS) managers’
              likelihood of recommending purchase. As a result, both the
              criteria by which MIS managers evaluate prospective packaged
              systems and the attributes that lead to commercially competitive
              ERP software products are poorly understood. This paper examines
              this understudied issue through a conjoint study. We focus on ERP
              systems, which are among the largest and most complex packaged
              systems that are purchased by organizations. In a conjoint study,
              1008 evaluation decisions based on hypothetical ERP software
              package profiles were completed by managers in 126 organizations.
              The study represents the first empirical investigation of the
              relative importance that managers ascribe to various factors that
              are believed to be important in evaluating packaged software. The
              results provide important insights for both organizations that
              acquire such systems and those that develop them. The results
              show that functionality, reliability, cost, ease of use and ease
              of customization are judged to be important criteria, while ease
              of implementation and vendor reputation were not found to be
              significant. Functionality and reliability were found to be the
              most heavily weighted factors. We conclude the paper with a

              from an outsider position, as empirical objects. The humanities
              contribute to understanding, and critically reflecting on, the
              human experience of actors inside organized practices. This paper
              argues that, in view of the persistent relevance gap between
              theory and practice, organization studies should be broadened to
              include design as one of its primary modes of engaging in
              research. Design is characterized by its emphasis on solution
              finding, guided by broader purposes and ideal target systems.
              Moreover, design develops, and draws on, design propositions that
              are tested in pragmatic experiments and grounded in organization
              science. This study first explores the main differences and
              synergies between science and design, and explores how and why
              the design discipline has largely moved away from academia to
              other sites in the economy. The argument then turns to the
              genealogy of design methodologies in organization and management
              studies. Subsequently, this paper explores the circular design
              methodology that serves to illustrate the nature of design
              research, that is, the pragmatic focus on actionable knowledge as
              well as the key role of ideal target systems in design processes.
              Finally, the author proposes a framework for communication and
              collaboration between the science and design modes, and argues
              that scholars in organization studies can guide human beings in
              the process of designing and developing their organizations

               should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and

               environments people always rely on certain ``languages,'' which,
               like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and
               communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system
               which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of
               this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost
               any kind of building, or any part of the built environment.
               ``Patterns,'' the units of this language, are answers to design
               problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories
               should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should
               be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns
               in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem
               statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and
               a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of
               the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of
               things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human
               nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they
               are today.",

              new method is to use precisely the same group of users who work
              with the system as judges, a system we call Cross-Evaluation. In
              the new method, we also propose to assess the system at the level
              of task completion. The obvious potential limitation of this
              method is that individuals may be inclined to think more highly
              of the materials that they themselves have found and are almost
              certain to think more highly of their own work product than they
              do of the products built by others. The keys to neutralizing this
              problem are careful design and a corresponding analytical model
              based on analysis of variance. We model the several measures of
              task completion with a linear model of five effects, describing
              the users who interact with the system, the system used to finish
              the task, the task itself, the behavior of individuals as judges,
              and the self-judgment bias. Our analytical method successfully
              isolates the effect of each variable. This approach provides a
              successful model to make concrete the ``three-realities''
              paradigm, which calls for ``real tasks,'' ``real users,'' and

               habit of writing seminal publications near the start of each
               decade which establish the basis and framework for systems
               methodology research for that decade.'' Hamish Rennie, Journal
               of the Operational Research Society, 1992 Thirty years ago Peter
               Checkland set out to test whether the Systems Engineering (SE)
               approach, highly successful in technical problems, could be used
               by managers coping with the unfolding complexities of
               organizational life. The straightforward transfer of SE to the
               broader situations of management was not possible, but by
               insisting on a combination of systems thinking strongly linked
               to real-world practice Checkland and his collaborators developed
               an alternative approach - Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) - which
               enables managers of all kinds and at any level to deal with the
               subtleties and confusions of the situations they face. This work
               established the now accepted distinction between 'hard' systems
               thinking, in which parts of the world are taken to be 'systems'
               which can be 'engineered', and 'soft' systems thinking in which
               the focus is on making sure the process of inquiry into
               real-world complexity is itself a system for learning. Systems
               Thinking, Systems Practice (1981) and Soft Systems Methodology

               narrowly human-centered approaches which have dominated European
               thought for four centuries. In this readable introduction to his
               work, Andrew Collier expounds and defends the main concepts of
               Bhaskar’s philosophy.The first part of this book looks at the
               philosophy of experimental science and discusses the
               stratification of nature, showing how biological structures are
               founded on chemical ones yet are not reducible to them. This
               paves the way, in part two, for a discussion of the human
               sciences which demonstrates that the world they study is also
               rooted in and emergent from nature. Bhaskar’s concept of an
               ``explanatory critique'' (an explanation that is also a
               criticism, not in addition to, but by virtue of, its explanatory
               work) is discussed at length as a key concept for ethics and
               politics. Collier concludes by looking at the uses to which

               is based on the behavioral science paradigm, should be
               complemented with research based on the design science paradigm.
               The current IS design science frameworks and approaches have a
               strong focus on the IT artifact, in most cases an exclusive
               focus on the IT artifact. The frameworks and approaches have
               very little discussions and clarifications regarding
               underpinning philosophies, but most seem to be based on
               positivism, traditional realism, or pragmatism. This paper
               presents an alternative framework for IS design science
               research. The framework builds on that the aim of IS design
               science research is to develop practical knowledge for the
               design and realization of different classes of IS initiatives,
               where IS are viewed as socio-technical systems and not just IT
               artifacts. The underpinning philosophy of the framework is
               critical realism which has been developed as an alternative to
               positivism and traditional realism as well as to constructivism
               (relativism). The framework proposes that the output of IS
               design science research is practical IS design knowledge in the
               form of field-tested and grounded technological rules. The IS
               design knowledge is developed through an IS design science
               research cycle. The paper presents how technological rules can

              re-emerged as an important research paradigm in the field of
              information systems. However, the approaches currently
              recommended for conducting design science research do not include
              an ethical component. Thus, the objective of this paper is to
              initiate a debate about the need for ethical principles for DSR
              in Information Systems (IS). To launch this debate, we suggest
              that a set of ethical principles for DSR in IS must be created.
              Although the interpretation and application of these principles
              might not always be straightforward, our argument is that all DSR
              practitioners in IS should devote at least some time to consider
              ethical principles.",

  author    = "Schmidt, Eric and Cohen, Jared",
  abstract  = "In an unparalleled collaboration, two leading global thinkers in
               technology and foreign affairs give us their widely anticipated,
               transformational vision of the future: a world where everyone is
               connected---a world full of challenges and benefits that are
               ours to meet and to harness. Eric Schmidt is one of Silicon
               Valley’s great leaders, having taken Google from a small startup
               to one of the world’s most influential companies. Jared Cohen is
               the director of Google Ideas and a former adviser to secretaries
               of state Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. With their
               combined knowledge and experiences, the authors are uniquely
               positioned to take on some of the toughest questions about our
               future: Who will be more powerful in the future, the citizen or
               the state? Will technology make terrorism easier or harder to
               carry out? What is the relationship between privacy and
               security, and how much will we have to give up to be part of the
               new digital age? In this groundbreaking book, Schmidt and Cohen
               combine observation and insight to outline the promise and peril
               awaiting us in the coming decades. At once pragmatic and
               inspirational, this is a forward-thinking account of where our
               world is headed and what this means for people, states and
               businesses. With the confidence and clarity of visionaries,
               Schmidt and Cohen illustrate just how much we have to look
               forward to---and beware of---as the greatest information and
               technology revolution in human history continues to evolve. On
               individual, community and state levels, across every
               geographical and socioeconomic spectrum, they reveal the
               dramatic developments---good and bad---that will transform both
               our everyday lives and our understanding of self and society, as
               technology advances and our virtual identities become more and
               more fundamentally real. As Schmidt and Cohen’s nuanced vision
               of the near future unfolds, an urban professional takes his
               driverless car to work, attends meetings via hologram and
               dispenses housekeeping robots by voice; a Congolese fisherwoman
               uses her smart phone to monitor market demand and coordinate
               sales (saving on costly refrigeration and preventing
               overfishing); the potential arises for ``virtual statehood'' and
               ``Internet asylum'' to liberate political dissidents and
               oppressed minorities, but also for tech-savvy autocracies (and
               perhaps democracies) to exploit their citizens’ mobile devices
               for ever more ubiquitous surveillance. Along the way, we meet a
               cadre of international figures---including Julian Assange---who
               explain their own visions of our technology-saturated future.
               Inspiring, provocative and absorbing, The New Digital Age is a
               brilliant analysis of how our hyper-connected world will soon
               look, from two of our most prescient and informed public

               or merely synchronicity, Checkland appears to have developed a
               habit of writing seminal publications near the start of each
               decade which establish the basis and framework for systems
               methodology research for that decade.'' Hamish Rennie, Journal
               of the Operational Research Society, 1992 Thirty years ago Peter
               Checkland set out to test whether the Systems Engineering (SE)
               approach, highly successful in technical problems, could be used
               by managers coping with the unfolding complexities of
               organizational life. The straightforward transfer of SE to the
               broader situations of management was not possible, but by
               insisting on a combination of systems thinking strongly linked
               to real-world practice Checkland and his collaborators developed
               an alternative approach - Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) - which
               enables managers of all kinds and at any level to deal with the
               subtleties and confusions of the situations they face. This work
               established the now accepted distinction between 'hard' systems
               thinking, in which parts of the world are taken to be 'systems'
               which can be 'engineered', and 'soft' systems thinking in which
               the focus is on making sure the process of inquiry into
               real-world complexity is itself a system for learning. Systems
               Thinking, Systems Practice (1981) and Soft Systems Methodology
               in Action (1990) together with an earlier paper Towards a
               Systems-based Methodology for Real-World Problem Solving (1972)
               have long been recognized as classics in the field. Now-Peter
               Checkland has looked back over the three decades of SSM
               development, brought the account of it up to date, and reflected
               on the whole evolutionary process which has produced a mature
               SSM. SSM: A 30-Year Retrospective, here included with Soft
               Systems Methodology in Action closes a chapter on what is
               undoubtedly the most significant single research programme on
               the use of systems ideas in problem solving. Now retired from

               or merely synchronicity, Checkland appears to have developed a
               habit of writing seminal publications near the start of each
               decade which establish the basis and framework for systems
               methodology research for that decade.'' Hamish Rennie, Journal
               of the Operational Research Society, 1992 Thirty years ago Peter
               Checkland set out to test whether the Systems Engineering (SE)
               approach, highly successful in technical problems, could be used
               by managers coping with the unfolding complexities of
               organizational life. The straightforward transfer of SE to the
               broader situations of management was not possible, but by
               insisting on a combination of systems thinking strongly linked
               to real-world practice Checkland and his collaborators developed
               an alternative approach - Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) - which
               enables managers of all kinds and at any level to deal with the
               subtleties and confusions of the situations they face. This work
               established the now accepted distinction between 'hard' systems
               thinking, in which parts of the world are taken to be 'systems'
               which can be 'engineered', and 'soft' systems thinking in which
               the focus is on making sure the process of inquiry into
               real-world complexity is itself a system for learning. Systems
               Thinking, Systems Practice (1981) and Soft Systems Methodology
               in Action (1990) together with an earlier paper Towards a
               Systems-based Methodology for Real-World Problem Solving (1972)
               have long been recognized as classics in the field. Now Peter
               Checkland has looked back over the three decades of SSM
               development, brought the account of it up to date, and reflected
               on the whole evolutionary process which has produced a mature
               SSM. SSM: A 30-Year Retrospective, here included with Systems
               Thinking, Systems Practice closes a chapter on what is
               undoubtedly the most significant single research programme on
               the use of systems ideas in problem solving. Now retired from
               full-time university work, Peter Checkland continues his

               in Any Organization This is the definitive, realistic,
               actionable guide to starting fast with Scrum and agile--and then
               succeeding over the long haul. Leading agile consultant and
               practitioner Mike Cohn presents detailed recommendations,
               powerful tips, and real-world case studies drawn from his
               unparalleled experience helping hundreds of software
               organizations make Scrum and agile work. Succeeding with Agile
               is for pragmatic software professionals who want real answers to
               the most difficult challenges they face in implementing Scrum.
               Cohn covers every facet of the transition: getting started,
               helping individuals transition to new roles, structuring teams,
               scaling up, working with a distributed team, and finally,
               implementing effective metrics and continuous improvement.
               Throughout, Cohn presents ``Things to Try Now'' sections based
               on his most successful advice. Complementary ``Objection''
               sections reproduce typical conversations with those resisting
               change and offer practical guidance for addressing their
               concerns. Coverage includes Practical ways to get started

               software development practices, as embodied in the Rational
               Unified Process, or RUP. With the help of this book's practical
               advice and insight, software practitioners will learn how to
               tackle challenging development projects--small and large--using
               an iterative and risk-driven development approach with a proven
               track record. The Rational Unified Process Made Easy will teach
               you the key points involved in planning and managing iterative
               projects, the fundamentals of component design and software
               architecture, and the proper employment of use cases. All team
               members--from project managers to analysts, from developers to
               testers--will learn how to immediately apply the RUP to their
               work. You will learn that the RUP is a flexible, versatile
               process framework that can be tailored to suit the needs of
               development projects of all types and sizes. Key topics covered
               include: How to use the RUP to develop iteratively, adopt an
               architecture-centric approach, mitigate risk, and verify
               software quality Tasks associated with the four phases of the

  abstract = "The importance of tacit knowledge in organizational learning and
              innovation has become the focus of considerable attention in the
              recent literature. Our understanding of the nature of the links
              between tacit knowledge and organizational learning, however, has
              been hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework integrating
              micro-level learning activities with organizational forms and
              macro-level societal institutions. This paper seeks to achieve
              such an integrative task. It argues that there is an interactive
              relationship between dominant knowledge types and organizational
              forms. Further, the extent to which tacit knowledge constitutes
              the knowledge base of the firm, and how it is formed and used are
              powerfully shaped by the broader institutional context. The paper
              develops a four-fold typology at the cognitive, organizational
              and societal levels, as an analytical framework to explain the
              links between knowledge types, organizational forms and societal
              institutions. It shows how the three levels interact to shape the
              learning and innovative capabilities of firms. The theory
              developed in this paper represents the first attempt to integrate
              the diverse strands of literature and different levels of

               requirements for software-intensive systems. The various aspects
               of the process and the techniques are illustrated using numerous
               examples based on his extensive teaching experience and his work

               discovering, documenting and managing the requirements for a
               computer-based system. The goal of requirements engineering is
               to produce a set of system requirements which, as far as
               possible, is complete, consistent, relevant and reflects what
               the customer actually wants. Although this ideal is probably
               unattainable, the use of a systematic approach based on
               engineering principles leads to better requirements than the
               informal approach which is still commonly used. This book
               presents a set of guidelines which reflect the best practice in
               requirements engineering. Based on the authors' experience in
               research and in software and systems development, these
               guidelines explain in an easy-to-understand way how you can
               improve your requirements engineering processes. The guidelines

  author    = "Brown, Tim",
  abstract  = "The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed
               from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations
               come from a process of rigorous examination through which great
               ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new
               offerings and capabilities. This book introduces the idea of
               design thinking‚ the collaborative process by which the
               designer′s sensibilities and methods are employed to match
               people′s needs not only with what is technically feasible and a
               viable business strategy. In short‚ design thinking converts
               need into demand. It′s a human−centered approach to problem
               solving that helps people and organizations become more
               innovative and more creative. Design thinking is not just
               applicable to so−called creative industries or people who work
               in the design field. It′s a methodology that has been used by

               ideas. It is an approach that thousands of business managers,
               educators, and government leaders around the world have already
               adopted with great success. ``The main difficulty of thinking is
               confusion,'' writes Edward de Bono, long recognized as the
               foremost international authority on conceptual thinking and on
               the teaching of thinking as a skill. ``We try to do too much at
               once. Emotions, information, logic, hope, and creativity all
               crowd in on us. It is like juggling with too many balls.'' The
               solution? De Bono unscrambles the thinking process with his
               ``six thinking hats'': * WHITE HAT: neutral and objective,
               concerned with facts and figures * RED HAT: the emotional view *
               BLACK HAT: careful and cautious, the ``devil's advocate'' hat *
               YELLOW HAT: sunny and positive * GREEN HAT: associated with
               fertile growth, creativity, and new ideas * BLUE HAT: cool, the
               color of the sky, above everything else-the organizing hat
               Through case studies and real-life examples, Dr. de Bono reveals
               the often surprising ways in which deliberate role playing can
               make you a better thinker. He offers a powerfully simple tool
               that you-and your business, whether it's a start-up or a major
               corporation-can use to create a climate of clearer thinking,
               improved communication, and greater creativity. His book is an

              of the difference in brainstorming productivity typically
              observed between real and nominal groups. In Experiment 1, we
              manipulated assessment expectations in group and individual
              brainstorming. Although productivity was higher when subjects
              worked under personal rather than collective assessment
              instructions, type of session still had a major impact on
              brainstorming productivity under conditions that eliminated the
              temptation to free ride. Experiment 2 demonstrated that inducing
              evaluation apprehension reduced productivity in individual
              brainstorming. However, the failure to find an interaction
              between evaluation apprehension and type of session in Experiment
              3 raises doubts about evaluation apprehension as a major
              explanation of the productivity loss in brainstorming groups.
              Finally, by manipulating blocking directly, we determined in
              Experiment 4 that production blocking accounted for most of the
              productivity loss of real brainstorming groups. The processes

               improvements in computer and communications technology,
               increasingly can develop their own new products and services.
               These innovating users -- both individuals and firms -- often
               freely share their innovations with others, creating
               user-innovation communities and a rich intellectual commons. In
               Democratizing Innovation, Eric von Hippel looks closely at this
               emerging system of user-centered innovation. He explains why and
               when users find it profitable to develop new products and
               services for themselves, and why it often pays users to reveal
               their innovations freely for the use of all.The trend toward
               democratized innovation can be seen in software and information
               products -- most notably in the free and open-source software
               movement -- but also in physical products. Von Hippel's many
               examples of user innovation in action range from surgical
               equipment to surfboards to software security features. He shows
               that product and service development is concentrated among
               ``lead users,'' who are ahead on marketplace trends and whose
               innovations are often commercially attractive.Von Hippel argues
               that manufacturers should redesign their innovation processes
               and that they should systematically seek out innovations
               developed by users. He points to businesses -- the custom
               semiconductor industry is one example -- that have learned to
               assist user-innovators by providing them with toolkits for
               developing new products. User innovation has a positive impact
               on social welfare, and von Hippel proposes that government
               policies, including R\&D subsidies and tax credits, should be
               realigned to eliminate biases against it. The goal of a
               democratized user-centered innovation system, says von Hippel,
               is well worth striving for. An electronic version of this book

              product categories characterized by rapid change---such as ``high

              real-world experience needed to problem solve and provide
              accurate data to inquiring market researchers. In this paper I
              explore the problem and propose a solution: Marketing research
              analyses which focus on what I term the ``lead users'' of a
              product or process. Lead users are users whose present strong
              needs will become general in a marketplace months or years in the
              future. Since lead users are familiar with conditions which lie
              in the future for most others, they can serve as a
              need-forecasting laboratory for marketing research. Moreover,
              since lead users often attempt to fill the need they experience,
              they can provide new product concept and design data as well. In

              described as the best way to be creative and innovate, while
              within the design realm, design thinking may be partly ignored
              and taken for granted, despite a long history of academic
              development and debate. In the design area, we find five
              different discourses of ‘designerly thinking’, or ways to
              describe what designers do in practice, that have distinctly
              different epistemological roots. These different discourses do
              not stand in competition with each other but could be developed
              in parallel. We also observe that the management discourse has
              three distinct origins, but in general has a more superficial and
              popular character and is less academically anchored than the
              designerly one. Also, the management design thinking discourse
              seldom refers to designerly thinking and thereby hinders
              cumulative knowledge construction. We suggest further research to
              link the discourses.",

  abstract = "Objective To test whether the anchoring and order cognitive
              biases experienced during search by consumers using information
              retrieval systems can be corrected to improve the accuracy of,
              and confidence in, answers to health-related questions. Design A
              prospective study was conducted on 227 undergraduate students who
              used an online search engine developed by the authors to find
              health information and then answer six randomly assigned consumer
              health questions. The search engine was fitted with a baseline
              user interface and two modified interfaces specifically designed
              to debias anchoring or order effect. Each subject used all three
              user interfaces, answering two questions with each. Measurements
              Frequencies of correct answers pre- and post- search and
              confidence in answers were collected. Time taken to search and
              then answer a question, the number of searches conducted and the
              number of links accessed in a search session were also recorded.
              User preferences for each interface were measured. Chi-square
              analyses tested for the presence of biases with each user
              interface. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checked for equality of
              distribution of the evidence analyzed for each user interface.
              The test for difference between proportions and the Wilcoxon
              signed ranks test were used when comparing interfaces. Results
              Anchoring and order effects were present amongst subjects using
              the baseline search interface (anchoring: p < 0.001; order: p =
              0.026). With use of the order debiasing interface, the initial
              order effect was no longer present (p = 0.34) but there was no
              significant improvement in decision accuracy (p = 0.23). While
              the anchoring effect persisted when using the anchor debiasing
              interface (p < 0.001), its use was associated with a 10.3\%
              increase in subjects who had answered incorrectly pre-search,
              answering correctly post-search (p = 0.10). Subjects using either
              debiasing user interface conducted fewer searches and accessed
              more documents compared to baseline (p < 0.001). In addition, the
              majority of subjects preferred using a debiasing interface over
              baseline. Conclusion This study provides evidence that (i)
              debiasing strategies can be integrated into the user interface of
              a search engine; (ii) information interpretation behaviors can be
              to some extent debiased; and that (iii) attempts to debias
              information searching by consumers can influence their ability to
              answer health-related questions accurately, their confidence in
              these answers, as well as the strategies used to conduct searches

               that gifted individuals -- readily identifiable ``creative
               types'' -- offer the quickest route to out-of-the-box,
               breakthrough thinking, and if you don't have an eccentric genius
               on your team, your group is doomed to mediocrity. Yet, say
               Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap. most innovations today spring
               from well-led group interactions. In ``When Sparks Fly, '' the
               authors sweep aside the conventional thinking about creativity
               to reveal that any group -- if designed and managed effectively
               -- can produce more innovative services, products, and
               processes.Unlike most books on creativity, ``When Sparks Fly''
               focuses on the process as it applies to groups of people who may
               not fit the stereotype of right-brained ``creatives.'' Leonard
               and Swap offer managers proven strategies for generating the
               group dynamics that lie at the heart of innovative thinking,
               including specific techniques for re-channeling the tensions of
               conflicting points of view into new ideas and alternative
               options. They show how forward-looking companies such as Fisher
               Price, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard use group situations to
               maximize their creative potential.``When Sparks Fly'' explores
               how all aspects of the work environment, from leadership style
               to the use of space, sound, even smell, can enhance innovation.
               It will help managers motivate and lead groups of people in ways

              between user participation and system outcomes. There has been
              considerable research activity in this area but findings are
              inconclusive. Comparatively little qualitative research has been
              reported. This paper reports an interpretive study that examined
              the development process for 38 decision support systems in the
              Australian agricultural sector. The relationship between user
              participation and system outcome was explored. The degree of user
              influence in the design process was found to be an important
              component of this relationship. Degree of user influence was a
              result of both the type and depth of user participation. Much
              previous research has focused on whether users were involved in
              development without detailed consideration of the degree of
              influence on design features resulting from this participation.
              The results from this study are significant in that they yield
              theoretical insights into the phenomenon of user participation

              known by the name incubation. A new hypothesis regarding the
              incubation mechanism is suggested. It is based on analysis of the
              structure of insight problems and their solution process.
              According to this hypothesis, no activity takes place during the
              break. The break's only function is to divert the solver's
              attention from the problem, thus releasing her mind from the grip
              of a false organizing assumption. This enables the solver to
              apply a new organizing assumption to the problem's components
              upon returning to the problem. The numbers of experimental
              studies that confirm the existence of the incubation phenomenon,
              and those that do not support it, are roughly equal, thus the
              primary experimental aim of the study is to improve the
              methodology of manipulating the break. This was done by starting
              the break only after an impasse has been reached. The results
              indicate that the break improves performance in insight problem
              solving, but its length does not make a difference. This supports
              the suggested hypothesis and does not support hypotheses that

               specific needs of particular courses and favored approaches.
               Offering comprehensive coverage from traditional approaches
               through to the most recent agile methods, the book's unique

               delivery to projects around the world.'' --From the Foreword by
               Grady Booch This book is a comprehensive guide to modern
               software development practices, as embodied in the Rational
               Unified Process, or RUP. With the help of this book's practical
               advice and insight, software practitioners will learn how to
               tackle challenging development projects--small and large--using
               an iterative and risk-driven development approach with a proven
               track record. The Rational Unified Process Made Easy will teach
               you the key points involved in planning and managing iterative
               projects, the fundamentals of component design and software
               architecture, and the proper employment of use cases. All team
               members--from project managers to analysts, from developers to
               testers--will learn how to immediately apply the RUP to their
               work. You will learn that the RUP is a flexible, versatile
               process framework that can be tailored to suit the needs of
               development projects of all types and sizes. Key topics covered
               include: How to use the RUP to develop iteratively, adopt an
               architecture-centric approach, mitigate risk, and verify
               software quality Tasks associated with the four phases of the
               RUP: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition Roles
               and responsibilities of project managers, architects, analysts,

               Incrementally adopting the RUP with minimal risk Common patterns
               for failure with the RUP--and how to avoid them Use this book to
               get quickly up to speed with the RUP, so you can easily employ

               students to the area of social science theory and research that
               has come to be known as social constructionism. Using a variety
               of examples from everyday experience and from existing research
               in areas such as personality, sexuality and health, the basic
               theoretical assumptions of social constructionism are clearly
               explained. Key debates, such as the nature and status of
               knowledge, truth, reality and the self are given in-depth
               analysis in an accessible style. The theoretical and practical
               issues relevant to social constructionist research are
               illustrated with examples from real empirical studies, and the
               different approaches to social constructionist research are
               clearly defined. While the text is broadly sympathetic to social
               constructionism, the weaknesses of the approach are also
               addressed through a critical approach to the material, and in
               the final chapter the theory is subjected to a more extensive
               critique. Social Constructionism, Second Edition, extends and

  title     = "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions: 50th Anniversary
               Edition",
  author    = "Kuhn, Thomas S",
  abstract  = "A good book may have the power to change the way we see the
               world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily
               consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take
               it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging
               its ideas once were---and still are. The Structure of Scientific
               Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in
               1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of
               science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.
               With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged
               long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing
               that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day,
               gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but
               that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that
               disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur
               outside of ``normal science,'' as he called it. Though Kuhn was
               writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how
               scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass
               over time in research experiments are still instructive in our
               biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the
               history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian
               Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including
               paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the
               science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the
               book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background
               information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed,
               with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by
               the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history
               of our perspectives on science.",

               being monitored and assessed---and often in ways that are
               imperceptible to us. The first general introduction to the
               growing field of surveillance studies, SuperVision uses examples
               drawn from everyday technologies to show how surveillance is
               used, who is using it, and how it affects our world. Beginning
               with a look at the activities and technologies that connect most
               people to the surveillance matrix, from identification cards to
               GPS devices in our cars to Facebook, John Gilliom and Torin
               Monahan invite readers to critically explore surveillance as it
               relates to issues of law, power, freedom, and inequality. Even
               if you avoid using credit cards and stay off Facebook, they
               show, going to work or school inevitably embeds you in
               surveillance relationships. Finally, they discuss the more
               obvious forms of surveillance, including the security systems
               used at airports and on city streets, which both epitomize
               contemporary surveillance and make impossibly grand promises of
               safety and security. Gilliom and Monahan are among the foremost
               experts on surveillance and society, and, with SuperVision, they
               offer an immensely accessible and engaging guide, giving readers
               the tools to understand and to question how deeply surveillance
               has been woven into the fabric of our everyday lives.",

               Knowledge",
  author    = "Argote, Linda",
  abstract  = "Why do some organizations learn at faster rates than others? Why
               do organizations ``forget''? Could productivity gains acquired
               in one part of an organization be transferred to another? These
               are among the questions addressed in Organizational Learning:
               Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge. Since its
               original publication in 1999, this book has set the standard for
               research and analysis in the field. This fully updated and
               expanded edition showcases the most current research and
               insights, featuring a new chapter that provides a theoretical
               framework for analyzing organizational learning and presents
               evidence about how the organizational context affects learning
               processes and outcomes. Drawing from a wide array of studies
               across the spectrum of management, economics, sociology, and
               psychology, Organizational Learning explores the dynamics of
               learning curves in organizations, with particular emphasis on
               how individuals and groups generate, share, reinforce, and
               sometimes forget knowledge. With an increased emphasis on
               service organizations, including healthcare, Linda Argote
               demonstrates that organizations vary dramatically in the rates
               at which they learn---with profound implications for
               productivity, performance, and managerial and strategic decision
               making.",

              information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users

              data base relations, and the concept of a universal data
              sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on
